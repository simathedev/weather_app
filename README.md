# Weather App created with react
### I've been learning React and I decided to put the knowledge I've obtained so far into practice.

## Features of weather app:
* Simple Modern UI
* Enter any city name and it'll return the weather data for that city
	* returns the _average_ temp
	* returns the _min_ temp
	* returns the _max_ temp
	* returns the _description_ of the weather (e.g., sunny,rainy,light clouds)
* It includes an _icon_ of the weather(adds a little character ;D)
* It displays an error message when it's unable to return data
* Responsive to screen size
